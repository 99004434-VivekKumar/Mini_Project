# Requirements
## Introduction
* Marienbad was a 1962 Polish puzzle mainframe game created by Elwro engineer Witold Podgórski in Wrocław, Poland for its Odra 1003. It was an adaption of the logic game nim.
* The game had players opposing the computer in alternating rounds of removing matches from a set, with the last player to take a match the loser. As the computer always played the optimal moves, it was essentially unbeatable.

## How to play
* Players take turns removing at least one object from a set of objects, traditionally matchsticks, with the goal of either being or not being the player who removes the last object. 
* The gameplay options can be modeled mathematically.The default game mode consists of, four rows of matches were generated, with either one, three, five or seven matches within each row. 
* The side that was left with the last match lost. The computer printout showed the player and the current layout of matches. A single player could play the game at a time, whose turn alternated with the computer's.

## Research/ History
* Like many games in the early history of video games, Marienbad did not spread far beyond the initial location. Mainframe computers were rare throughout the world and primarily located in government or military institutions or large corporations, so were generally unavailable for amusement purposes.
* Elwro produced only 42 Odra 1003 mainframes between 1963 and 1965.
* The game did spread beyond the Elwro factory, however. After developing the game, Podgórski became a student at the Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna and with the assistance of fellow student Bogdan Bleja set up a version of the game there on an Odra 1003 that was mediated by a university operator. 
* The computer, and therefore the game, could be used or played by any student, but only through an operator who received the intended input from the player and passed the information to the computer.
* In later years, variants of nim and Marienbad were the second most popular type of computer game present on Polish computers after noughts and crosses, since it was a relatively simple game to program.
* Marienbad is considered one of the first Polish video games, developed almost 20 years before later candidates OiX (1984), Gąsienica (1985), and Puszka Pandory (1986).
 

## Cost and Features

## Cost
* The project is implemented using Visual Studio Code on windows and Linux in C language. The softwares are open Source and hence are freely available. So, No costs incurred.
